                There are N blocks, numbered from 0 to N-1, arranged in a row. A couple of Teens were sitting together on one block when they had a terrible quarrel. Now they want to jump away from one another so that the distance between them will be as large as possible. The distance between blocks numbered J and K, where J < K, is computed as K-J+ 1. The Teens can only jump up, meaning that they can move from one block to another only if the two blocks are adjacent and the second block is of the same or greater height as the first. What is the longest distance that they can possibly create between each other, if they also chose to sit on the optimal starting block initially?
